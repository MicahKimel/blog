Can you add a gallery tab and an about us tab? We'll send some photos for those, but you can probably also find some on backsplash.com. We'll send you some write-ups about us and about the company to add there. 

On the inquiry page can you add another box, probably a big one that says something like:

"Tell us up to three important things to you and your family when you're planning a dream experience in a new place!
Are you a foodie who loves to spend time trying every unique dish and delicacy from a new place?
Do you love adventuring up and down mountain peaks or rafting down rivers, chasing thrills?
Do you value time in restful, peaceful spaces getting to soak in the sounds and colors of an unexplored area?
Tell us and our team of locals will dream up a package that will satisfy your hearts and your wallets in the beautiful Himalayas."
